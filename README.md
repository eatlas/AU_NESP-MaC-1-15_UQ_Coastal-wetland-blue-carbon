See the [metadata record for this dataset](https://doi.org/10.26274/76jj-tk94) for more information about this dataset and how it was produced.

## Summary
This repository contains the spatial analysis workflow, data derived from the spatial analysis, and R code to identify the blue carbon restoration opportunity in three case study regions in Australia: 
1) Fitzroy Basin, QLD; 
2) Peel-Harvey and northern part of South West Catchments, WA; and 
3) Ord River, WA. 

It uses a multi-stage approach to identify: 
1) potential coastal wetland restoration sites across case study regions based on biophysical suitability; 
2) their carbon abatement following the Australian Government Tidal restoration of blue carbon ecosystems method; 
3) their economic feasibility under a carbon market using cost-benefit analysis with variations of carbon abatement, restoration cost, discount rate, carbon price, and farm gross margin; and 
4) their co-benefits for biodiversity, fisheries, water quality, and coastal protection, and evaluation of their cost-effectiveness considering profitability, restoration feasibility, and provision of co-benefits. 
Potential cultural benefits were also evaluated. This work package supports the regional approach developed for selecting coastal wetland restoration sites for blue carbon and co-benefits in Australia (Hagger et al. 2024 Journal of Environmental Management).

The methods to perform the analyses for each case study region are provided in Hagger et al. (2024). The approach integrates spatial analysis with R data analysis. The spatial analysis workflows provided in this work package provide details on the methodology for the extraction of data. The R scripts are annotated with methods for the data analysis.
